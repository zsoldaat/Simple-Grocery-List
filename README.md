# Simple-Grocery-List
Simple Grocery List is a basic and effective way of storing and organizing your favourite recipies. It also lets you generate a set of meals for the week with a grocery list that lets you see all the ingredients you require in one place.

Simple grocery list intentionally keeps the measurements of ingredients vague so you can tailor your recipes and grocery lists to your needs; whether "1 egg" means one individual egg, or one carton of eggs is totally up to you.
