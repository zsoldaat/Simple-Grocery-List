# Description

Simple Grocery List is a basic and effective way of storing and organizing your favourite recipies. It also lets you generate a set of meals for the week with a grocery list that lets you see all the ingredients you require in one place.

Simple grocery list intentionally keeps the measurements of ingredients vague so you can tailor your recipes and grocery lists to your needs; whether "1 egg" means one individual egg, or one carton of eggs is totally up to you. 

# Technology

This app was created entirely in SwiftUI, using no external libraries. It uses the CoreData framework to persist user data locally, and was my first (arguably unsuccessful) attempt to conform to the MVVM design pattern in SwiftUI.

This is my first published IOS app, I'm proud of the progress I made to get to this point, but I already know there is a lot of room for improvement both in terms of usability, as well as code structure and design patterns.
